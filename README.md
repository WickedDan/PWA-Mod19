# PWA Text Editor Mod19

## Description
A text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
## Installation
No installation needed! But you may download the github repo and run the server.js file for offline use!
